# Setup automation — Specification

> Status: **design** (not yet implemented). Collapses the `docs/auto-approval-setup.md`
> checklist from a ~9-step copy-paste-and-edit chore into three pieces: reusable
> workflows the adopter calls in a few lines, a one-click GitHub App provisioning flow,
> and a `waiver setup` command that wires the rest without touching what's already there.

## 1. Purpose & scope

Today, adopting the auto-approval layer means: paste two ~100-line workflow files and
hand-edit their marked points, hand-maintain a `ci-checks` list (with a matrix-leg
footgun), create a correctly-scoped GitHub App by hand (with a permission footgun that
silently doesn't count), set branch protection, patch commitlint, and read a long "why"
for each. `docs/auto-approval-setup.md` is careful and correct — and long, because every
step is manual.

This spec defines three components that shrink that to **run one command, click twice**:

- **A — Reusable workflows** (`workflow_call`): the two templates become thin callers.
  The security-load-bearing shape moves into this repo, versioned and pinned. Required
  checks are **auto-discovered**, deleting the hand-maintained `ci-checks` list (including
  the lockfile-honesty check, assuming `lockfile-assay`).
- **B — App Manifest one-click flow**: provisions a per-adopter App with the exact scopes,
  via GitHub's manifest→conversion handshake. No shared secret, no hosted backend.
- **C — `waiver setup`**: an interactive CLI that validates prerequisites, drives B over a
  loopback server, provisions secrets, merges branch-protection additively, patches
  commitlint, drops the caller workflows without overwriting anything, and ends on a
  hand-off page listing only what we deliberately left manual.

**Non-negotiable carry-over from the core design:** none of this weakens the trust model.
The reviewer still runs **this repo's** pinned default-branch code with the **adopter's**
token; no third party gains standing access; every failure is fail-closed (worst case =
today's normal review). Components A–C reduce *setup friction*, never the safety bar.

**Hard constraint — the target repo is already operational.** `waiver setup` runs against
a fully-configured repo. It must be **additive, idempotent, and non-destructive**: never
overwrite an existing workflow, never replace a branch-protection rule set (only merge in
the checks it needs), back up before editing any tracked file, and re-running must
converge, not duplicate.

Out of scope: changing the stamping engine, the op vocabulary, or the verdict semantics.
This is purely the adoption/onboarding surface.

---

## 2. Component A — Reusable workflows + check autodiscovery

### 2.1 Packaging: thin callers over `workflow_call`

Ship two reusable workflows in this repo under `.github/workflows/`, each exposing a
`workflow_call` trigger and wrapping the existing composite/node actions
(`.github/actions/waiver-stamp`, `.github/actions/waiver-stamp-review`) — the actions stay
the implementation; the reusable workflows are the adopter-facing entry points.

- `jsalvata/waiver-stamp/.github/workflows/ci.yml@vX` — the producer (unprivileged,
  `pull_request`).
- `jsalvata/waiver-stamp/.github/workflows/review.yml@vX` — the reviewer (privileged,
  `workflow_run`).

The adopter's two files collapse to callers. Producer:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/waiver-stamp-ci.yml  (standalone — does NOT touch existing CI)
name: waiver-stamp-ci
on: { pull_request: {} }
jobs:
  waiver-stamp:
    uses: jsalvata/waiver-stamp/.github/workflows/ci.yml@v1.16.0
```

Reviewer:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/waiver-stamp-review.yml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [CI, waiver-stamp-ci]   # <-- discovered & baked in by `waiver setup`
    types: [completed]
jobs:
  review:
    uses: jsalvata/waiver-stamp/.github/workflows/review.yml@v1.16.0
    secrets: inherit
```

The hardened checkout/fetch/guard shape (default-branch checkout, `git fetch` head-as-data,
never-execute-PR-code) now lives inside `review.yml` in **this** repo. Adopters can't
misconfigure it, and we harden it centrally by shipping a new pin.

**Pinning is unchanged in spirit** (`docs/auto-approval-setup.md` §"Which ref to pin"):
`@vX` is paste-safe because we keep `v*` tags immutable; hash-pin adopters swap in the SHA.
The pin now covers the *workflow* as well as the action and CLI — a strictly larger
trusted surface moved off the adopter.

### 2.2 The producer as a standalone workflow

The producer runs as its own `pull_request` workflow rather than a job merged into the
adopter's CI. This is what lets `waiver setup` avoid editing arbitrary CI YAML (§4.8).

It works because the reviewer locates the report **by head SHA across all workflow runs**,
not by the triggering run — `src/action/adapters.ts:fetchArtifact` already
`listWorkflowRunsForRepo({ head_sha })` and its own comment anticipates "the triggering
`workflow_run` may be a different backstop workflow, e.g. CI." So the producer artifact is
found regardless of which workflow woke the reviewer. No code change needed for this.

### 2.3 The reviewer trigger model: multiple workflows, last-wake-wins

Because the producer is separate, a single workflow completion no longer guarantees *all*
required checks are done. The reviewer therefore triggers on **every workflow that
produces a required check** — the adopter's CI workflow(s) **and** `waiver-stamp-ci` — and
re-evaluates on each `completed` event:

- Each wake re-confirms **all** required checks are green on the head SHA (`confirmChecksGreen`
  in `src/action/backstop.ts` — unchanged logic). Not-all-green ⇒ fail-closed no-op.
- The **last** workflow to finish is the wake where everything is green ⇒ it posts.

Cost: up to *k* wakes for *k* triggering workflows, all but the last a cheap no-op. Sound
under the pwn-request model — the reviewer runs trusted default-branch code and re-derives
everything from the head SHA regardless of which workflow triggered it; more wakes just
means more fail-closed no-ops.

`workflow_run.workflows` is static YAML and cannot be discovered at runtime, so the CI
workflow name(s) are the **one** value baked into the caller — `waiver setup` discovers and
fills them (§4.8). This is naming a *workflow*, not maintaining a *check list*; the check
list is what §2.4 removes.

### 2.4 Check autodiscovery (removes the manual `ci-checks` list)

The reviewer discovers the set of required checks instead of reading a hand-maintained
input. Source of truth: the base branch's **required status checks**, read from the
rulesets endpoint (which surfaces both classic branch protection and rulesets):

```
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/{base}
```

collecting every `required_status_checks` rule's `context` values. Fallback to the classic
`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{base}/protection/required_status_checks` if the rules
endpoint yields none (repo still on legacy protection).

This dissolves the two footguns `docs/auto-approval-setup.md` warns about:

- **Matrix legs** — protection stores the *actual* contexts (`integration (9.12.0)`,
  `integration (10.0.0)`), so autodiscovery gets exact leg names for free.
- **Push-only checks** — required status checks are inherently PR checks; a push-only
  `release` job is never in the set, so it can't hang the reviewer.

**Self-exclusion:** the discovered set includes `waiver-stamp` itself (the adopter marks it
required, §4.6). The reviewer must drop its own check name from the backstop set — its
verdict *is* the artifact it trusts, so waiting on it would deadlock. Excluded by a
constant check-name (`waiver-stamp`).

**Base branch, per PR:** discovery keys off `pr.base` (already resolved, `main.ts:59-61`),
so a repo with different protection on different base branches gets the right set per PR.

### 2.5 Lockfile-honesty autodiscovery (assume `lockfile-assay`)

Today `lockfile-honesty-checks` is a separate manual input that (a) joins the backstop set
and (b) flips `lockfileHonestyConfigured`, which silences the "assumes the lockfile is
honest" caveat on APPROVE (`src/action/decide.ts:42`, `main.ts:93`). The (a) part is
subsumed by §2.4 — a required lockfile-honesty check is already in the discovered set and
already must be green; nothing extra to do. Only (b) needs a signal: *which* discovered
check is the honesty gate.

**The check-run name is adopter-defined, so a fixed constant won't match.** It is the
producing job's name/id, not the tool name — in this very repo the `lockfile-assay`
workflow's job is `assay`, so its check-run is **`assay`**, not `lockfile-assay`. Matching a
hardcoded `lockfile-assay` would silently fail here.

Resolution: read the honesty check name from an **optional `lockfileHonestyCheck` field in
`.waiver-stamp.json`** (default absent). This is consistent with how the reviewer already
reads policy from the base commit, so it can't be widened by a PR. `waiver setup` fills it
by detecting the adopter's lockfile-assay workflow and extracting its job/check name (§4.8).
Behavior:

- **Matched** (a discovered required check equals `lockfileHonestyCheck`) ⇒
  `lockfileHonestyConfigured := true`, caveat silenced.
- **Unset or unmatched** ⇒ `lockfileHonestyConfigured := false` — the APPROVE body keeps the
  caveat. This is the **fail-safe** default: the flag only toggles a *warning string*, and
  wrongly *silencing* it is the only harmful direction, so we silence only on a positive
  match. `lockfile-assay` is the assumed tool per directive, but its check *name* is
  discovered, never assumed.

### 2.6 Token & permissions for autodiscovery

Reading required-status-check config needs more than the default token grants. The workflow
`GITHUB_TOKEN` has **no `administration` permission scope** (it is not among the grantable
keys), and the rulesets/branch-protection reads require repository **Administration: read**
for private repos. Therefore autodiscovery reads run under the **App installation token**,
whose App is granted `administration: read` (§3.1). Concretely:

- The reviewer uses the App token (when configured) for the autodiscovery read **and** the
  approve post; it uses the default token only for the reads the default token *can* do.
- Because `waiver setup` always provisions the App (§4.3), the setup-produced configuration
  always has an `administration: read`-capable token — so autodiscovery is available by
  default and the manual list is genuinely gone.

**No-App fallback** (an adopter who declines the App and keeps the human click): the default
token can't read protection, so autodiscovery can't run. In that mode the reviewer falls
back to the optional override input (§2.7); empty ⇒ fail-closed no-op with a clear log line,
never a silent approve. This keeps the happy path list-free without stranding the
default-token path.

> ⚠️ **Verify before build (§7-V1):** whether `GET /rules/branches/{branch}` returns
> `required_status_checks` contexts to a token with only `contents: read` on a *private*
> repo, or truly requires `administration: read`. If `contents: read` suffices, autodiscovery
> also works on the default token and the no-App fallback (§2.7) can be dropped and the App's
> `administration: read` scope removed. The spec assumes the conservative (admin-read) answer.

### 2.7 Override escape hatch (kept, empty by default)

Retain a single optional input `ci-checks` on `review.yml`, **empty by default**. It is not
part of the setup-produced happy path — `waiver setup` writes no list. It exists only for
(a) the no-App fallback of §2.6, and (b) repos whose required set isn't discoverable for
some edge reason. Empty + non-discoverable ⇒ fail-closed no-op (log: "no required checks
discovered and no override set — not approving"). The old `lockfile-honesty-checks` input is
**removed** (folded into §2.5).

---

## 3. Component B — App Manifest one-click flow

Provisions a **per-adopter** App with exact scopes. Each adopter owns their App and holds
their own private key; we distribute a config template, never a shared secret, and run no
backend. Mechanism is GitHub's App-Manifest flow (the same handshake Probot's app-creation
uses in production).

### 3.1 The manifest

```json
{
  "name": "waiver-stamp-<owner>",
  "url": "https://github.com/jsalvata/waiver-stamp",
  "public": false,
  "default_permissions": {
    "contents": "write",
    "pull_requests": "write",
    "administration": "read"
  },
  "default_events": []
}
```

- **`contents: write`** — the documented requirement for an approving review to *count*
  (`docs/auto-approval-setup.md` §8): GitHub counts an App's approval only from an identity
  with repository write access, which for an App is `Contents: write`. Baking it into the
  manifest kills the "I granted only Pull-requests-write and it silently didn't count"
  footgun.
- **`pull_requests: write`** — submit the review.
- **`administration: read`** — read required-status-check config for autodiscovery (§2.6).
  Read-only repo config; low marginal risk over the write scope already present. Drop it if
  §7-V1 shows the default token can read rules.
- **No webhook / no events** — the App is a passive *identity* consumed by the adopter's
  Actions via `actions/create-github-app-token`; it is never a running service. This is the
  key difference from Probot (which wants the webhook secret + a process).

**Name uniqueness.** App names → slugs are globally unique. Suffix the globally-unique owner
login: `waiver-stamp-<owner>`. Deterministic, which is also the reuse key (§4.3): a second
run finds the existing App instead of colliding. Sanitize to the slug charset (lowercase,
non-alphanumeric → hyphen) and handle the name length cap (truncate long owner logins +
short hash suffix).

### 3.2 The flow (loopback, driven by `waiver setup`)

The redirect is captured on **loopback** — no hosted page, and the one-time `code` never
leaves the adopter's machine (strictly more private than a GitHub-Pages redirect, whose
request would transit Pages access logs).

1. `waiver setup` binds `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral-port>`, generates a random `state`.
2. Opens the browser to a page **its own server** serves: a self-submitting `<form method=POST>`
   targeting `https://github.com/settings/apps/new` (personal) or
   `https://github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/apps/new` (org), carrying the manifest and
   `redirect_url=http://localhost:<port>/callback`.
3. Adopter reviews the (pre-scoped) permissions and clicks **Create GitHub App**. The App is
   created **under their account/org**; they own it.
4. GitHub redirects the browser to `http://localhost:<port>/callback?code=…&state=…`; the
   local server captures it (verifies `state`).
5. Server `POST /app-manifests/{code}/conversions` → `{ id, pem, slug, … }`. (Code is
   single-use, ~1h TTL.)
6. Server writes secrets (§4.5) and serves a "done — now install the App" page linking
   `https://github.com/apps/<slug>/installations/new`.

**Standalone (non-CLI) variant.** For adopters who won't run the CLI, document the
**query-param prefill** fallback: a plain link to
`settings/apps/new?name=…&contents=write&pull_requests=write&administration=read`; the
adopter clicks Create, then on the App page clicks **Generate a private key** and copies the
App ID by hand. No redirect, no code, nothing to host — at the cost of two manual clicks and
no automated pem capture. (Exact query-param key names: §7-V2.)

### 3.3 The two irreducible clicks

Both stay human by design, not by omission:

- **"Create GitHub App"** — the adopter eyeballing exactly which scopes they grant. We *want*
  a human on `Contents: write`.
- **"Install on this repo"** — GitHub mandates an interactive repo-picker consent; there is no
  self-install API. The CLI can only *open* that page.

Everything between (create POST, code capture, conversion, secret write) is automated.

---

## 4. Component C — `waiver setup`

A new interactive subcommand: `waiver setup`. Wires everything B doesn't, additively and
idempotently, against an already-operational repo.

### 4.1 Preflight — validate prerequisites (fail fast, fix-it messages)

Check, and on any failure print the exact remediation and exit non-zero **before** mutating
anything:

- **Repo context:** cwd is inside a git work tree with a GitHub `origin`; resolve
  `owner/repo` and the default branch. (Determines personal vs org candidate in §4.2.)
- **`gh` present and authenticated** with a token that can administer the repo (needs repo
  admin to set secrets, edit protection). `gh auth status`; the App token cannot do these —
  this is the adopter's *own* admin credential, deliberately separate from the App key.
- **`git`** present.
- **Package manager / runtime** matching the documented floor: this is a **pnpm-only** tool
  (`allowBumping` is pnpm-lockfile-scoped; README "Scope (v0)"). Detect `pnpm-lock.yaml`;
  warn (don't hard-fail) if absent, since the reviewer layer still works without the
  dependency-bump op. Check Node `>=24` (`package.json engines`) only if the repo is *this
  kind* of project — for a pure adopter repo, Node floor is irrelevant to the reviewer, so
  this is informational.
- **Browser openable** (for the manifest flow) — else fall back to printing the URL.

Preflight is read-only; safe to run repeatedly (`waiver setup --check` runs only this and
reports).

### 4.2 Choose install target — personal or which org

Prompt: *"Where should the reviewer App live?"* — offer the personal account and each org the
authenticated user belongs to (from `gh api user/orgs`). The answer selects the manifest POST
target (§3.2) and the secret strategy (§4.5).

> **Decision D9 (recorded):** org install is the recommended default when available — org
> Actions secrets make multi-repo reuse near-free (§4.3, §4.5). Personal is offered but the
> prompt notes the per-repo secret consequence. If the user lacks rights to create an App in
> the chosen org (org policy may require an owner or admin approval), detect and message it
> clearly rather than failing opaquely mid-flow.

### 4.3 App provisioning — reuse, disk, or fresh

Resolution order:

1. **Reuse an existing installed App.** Because the name is deterministic
   (`waiver-stamp-<owner>`), check whether it already exists / is installed for this owner.
   - **Org owner:** if the App exists and org secrets are already set (§4.5), **no pem is
     needed** — skip creation, go straight to install-on-this-repo + workflow drop. This is
     the clean reuse path and it sidesteps the "can't re-mint a pem" constraint entirely
     (there is **no REST API to generate an App private key** — UI only, up to 25 keys).
   - **Personal owner:** the App can be reused but personal repos have no shared secret store
     and the pem can't be re-minted headlessly → need the pem from disk (step 2) or a fresh
     key.
2. **Disk (personal, opt-in — §4.4).** If a saved credentials file exists and the user opted
   to use it, load `{ app_id, pem }` from it and skip the manifest flow.
3. **Fresh manifest flow (§3.2).** Otherwise run the loopback create→convert, obtaining
   `{ app_id, pem, slug }`.

### 4.4 Personal-account pem-on-disk option

Only when the install target is a **personal account** (orgs use org secrets, so no local pem
persistence is needed), prompt two things:

- *"Save the App ID + private key to disk so you can configure more of your repos later
  without re-running the browser flow?"* → if yes, write `~/.waiver-install/<owner>.json`
  (`{ "app_id": …, "pem": … }`), **`chmod 600`**, directory `chmod 700`. Warn plainly that
  this is a private key at rest on disk.
- *"If such a file is found on a later run, use it instead of the browser flow?"* → records a
  preference so subsequent `waiver setup` runs for another repo under the same owner read the
  file (step 2 of §4.3) rather than re-minting.

Never persist a pem for an **org** target; never transmit a pem anywhere; never log it. The
file is the *only* at-rest copy and it is opt-in.

> **Decision D10 (recorded):** default is **not** to persist (secure default). The multi-repo
> convenience is opt-in and personal-only. Alternative considered: always persist to a
> keychain — rejected for v0 (extra platform-specific dependency; disk file with 600 perms is
> adequate and inspectable). Alternative: for personal multi-repo, batch-configure all chosen
> repos in one run while the pem is in memory — offered as the *no-persist* path (§4.5).

### 4.5 Secret provisioning

Reviewer references, by convention: `WAIVER_STAMP_APP_ID` and `WAIVER_STAMP_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.

- **Org target:** set **organization** Actions secrets (`gh secret set --org <org> … --repos
  <repo>` or `--visibility selected`). Set once; every repo's reviewer reads the same org
  secret. Reuse across repos then needs no pem at all (§4.3).
- **Personal target:** set **repo** Actions secrets (`gh secret set … --repo owner/repo`),
  from the fresh pem or the disk file. If the user declined disk persistence and wants
  several repos configured, offer to configure them all in this one run while the pem is
  in memory.
- **Environment-scoped secrets:** if the reviewer job uses an `environment:` (it need not —
  see §6), create the environment (`gh api`) and set env-scoped secrets to match. Default
  design uses **repo/org** secrets and **no** environment, which is simpler and sufficient;
  environment support is a documented option, not the default.

Multiline pem via `gh secret set … < file` / stdin. Overwriting an existing secret of the
same name is safe (idempotent) but prompt before clobbering a *differently-named* pre-existing
waiver secret.

### 4.6 Branch protection & rules — additive merge only

The target repo already has protection. **Never replace it.** Read the current required-checks
set for the default branch, then **add** (union) what's missing:

- Add `waiver-stamp` and the adopter's existing CI check(s) to *required status checks* (the
  CI checks are very likely already required; `waiver-stamp` is the new one).
- Enable **"Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed"** if not already
  on (`docs/auto-approval-setup.md` §4 — without it a stale bot APPROVE from a smaller range
  can linger).

Implementation reads the existing rule/protection object, computes the union, and PUTs the
merged object back — diffing first and showing the adopter exactly what will change, with a
confirm. Idempotent: re-running is a no-op once both checks are present. If the repo uses
**rulesets** rather than classic protection, edit the ruleset; if classic protection, edit
that — match whatever is in place, don't migrate them between mechanisms.

`.github/**` protection (CODEOWNERS/ruleset, `docs/auto-approval-setup.md` §7) is
*recommended, defense-in-depth* behind G1 — offered as an optional add, not forced.

### 4.7 commitlint & husky

- **commitlint `body-max-line-length`:** if the repo enforces it (detect
  `commitlint.config.*`), pretty-printed waiver JSON can exceed it and the `commit-msg` hook
  would reject waivered commits (`docs/auto-approval-setup.md` §6, README "Adopting…"). Patch
  the rule to `[0]` **only if present and non-zero**, minimally, preserving surrounding config
  (parse-edit-write, not regex-smash); show the diff, confirm.
- **husky:** the waiver flow itself needs no husky hook, but if the repo *already* uses husky
  (detect `.husky/`), do not reinitialize it or run `husky install`/`prepare` — leave it
  intact. If we add any hook (we do not by default), it must be appended, never overwrite an
  existing hook file. (This repo's own `.husky/pre-commit` runs `lockfile-assay check
  --staged`; an adopter's hooks are theirs — untouched.)

### 4.8 Workflow files — drop without smashing

- Write `.github/workflows/waiver-stamp-ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/waiver-stamp-review.yml`
  as the thin callers (§2.1). **If either path already exists, do not overwrite** — show a
  diff against what we would write and let the user reconcile; never clobber.
- **Discover the CI workflow name(s)** to bake into the reviewer caller's
  `workflow_run.workflows:` — from `.github/workflows/*.yml` `name:` fields and/or recent
  check-run→workflow associations on a recent PR head SHA. Present the discovered list for
  confirmation. This is the single value that must be right for the trigger model (§2.3).
- **Detect the lockfile-honesty check name** (§2.5): scan `.github/workflows/*.yml` for a job
  using the `lockfile-assay` action/package, extract its job/check name. Feed it into
  `.waiver-stamp.json` `lockfileHonestyCheck` **only via the seeding rule in §4.11** (include
  it when seeding a new file; recommend it on the hand-off page when the file already exists —
  never silently edit an existing policy file). If none found, leave unset (caveat stays —
  fail-safe).
- The producer is standalone, so we **never edit the adopter's existing CI workflow.** (An
  adopter who prefers the producer as a *job inside* their CI can do that by hand — it's on
  the hand-off page as an optional optimization, not something we automate.)

### 4.9 App installation — browser hand-off

Open `https://github.com/apps/<slug>/installations/new` and wait for the user to confirm they
installed it on the target repo (poll `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/installation` until present,
or let the user press Enter). Cannot be automated (§3.3).

### 4.10 Finish — the hand-off page (instructions only, no explanations)

End by opening a single page (local HTML served by the setup server, or a stable docs URL
with the repo's specifics filled in) that lists **only the steps we chose not to automate**,
as terse imperatives — no rationale, no prose:

1. Confirm the App is installed on `owner/repo`. *(if not already detected)*
2. Review `.waiver-stamp.json` and set `allowBumping` / `changeDocs` to taste. *(link to the
   recommended-deny template; we drop a closed-by-default file only if none exists — §4.11.)*
3. Set the repo to **merge-commit or rebase-merge** (not squash) to keep per-commit waivers.
4. *(Optional)* Add the `waiver-stamp` producer as a job inside your existing CI workflow
   instead of the standalone workflow.
5. *(Optional)* Protect `.github/**` with CODEOWNERS or a ruleset.

The page is generated with the adopter's `owner/repo`, App slug, and branch names
interpolated, so every step is copy-paste-ready. It explains nothing — the *why* lives in
`docs/auto-approval-setup.md`, linked once at the bottom.

### 4.11 `.waiver-stamp.json`

Policy is a security judgment (what docs/deps you'll auto-waive) — **not automated**
(`docs/auto-approval-setup.md` §3). If the file is **absent**, offer to drop the
closed-by-default recommended template (the exact `changeDocs.allow/deny` from the README,
`allowBumping: []`, plus the detected `lockfileHonestyCheck` from §4.8 if any). If it
**exists**, never touch it — surface it on the hand-off page for the user to review, and if a
lockfile-honesty check was detected but the field is missing, list adding
`lockfileHonestyCheck: "<name>"` as a suggested edit (never auto-applied). Every policy stays
closed-by-default; setup never widens permissions.

Adding `lockfileHonestyCheck` to the config is itself a schema change to
`schema/waiver-stamp-config.v0.schema.json` and the reviewer's base-policy reader — tracked
in the PR 1 tasks (§8).

### 4.12 CLI surface & exit codes

```
waiver setup [--check] [--yes] [--target personal|<org>] [--no-app]
```

- `--check` — run §4.1 preflight only; report and exit.
- `--yes` — accept recommended defaults for non-destructive prompts; still pause on the two
  human clicks (§3.3) and on any destructive-looking merge (§4.6/4.7) unless also explicitly
  confirmed.
- `--target` — skip the §4.2 prompt.
- `--no-app` — skip App provisioning; configure the human-click layer only (§2.6 fallback).

Exit codes reuse the existing contract (`src/commands/report.ts` `EXIT`): `0` success/no-op,
`2` malformed invocation / failed preflight, `3` internal error. Setup is **not** a verdict
command, so it never emits `1` (that code means REQUEST_CHANGES/invalid elsewhere).

Idempotent by construction: every mutating step checks current state first and converges. A
half-finished run (e.g. user closed the browser) is resumable — re-run and it picks up from
the first unsatisfied step.

---

## 5. Security analysis (deltas from the core model)

The core threat model (`docs/automation-layer.md`, spec §3.4) is unchanged. New surface:

- **Reusable workflow holds the shape.** Moving the checkout/fetch/guard shape into
  `review.yml@vX` *reduces* adopter risk (they can no longer misconfigure the pwn-request
  defense) and centralizes hardening. It also *enlarges* the code the adopter trusts by pin —
  mitigated exactly as today by immutable `v*` tags / hash-pinning, now covering the workflow
  too. No new privilege: the reviewer's token scope is unchanged.
- **Autodiscovery reads protection with `administration: read`.** Read-only repo config; it
  cannot mutate anything. It runs under the App token, not a new credential. Worst case of a
  wrong read is a *smaller* or *empty* required set → fail-closed no-op or (if it wrongly
  under-counted) an approve that still required every check it *did* see to be green **and**
  passed G1/G2 — but a maliciously-shrunk required set is not attacker-reachable from a PR
  (protection config is not PR-editable, and G1 blocks `.github/**` edits regardless). Net:
  no new approve-path weakening.
- **App Manifest / loopback.** The pem is created under the adopter's account and never leaves
  their machine (loopback capture, local conversion). No shared secret, no backend, no third
  party gains standing access — the property "no third party holds your write token" is
  preserved. The one-time `code` transits only `localhost`. Standard loopback hardening:
  bind `127.0.0.1` only, verify `state`, single-shot handler, short timeout, ephemeral port.
- **pem at rest (personal, opt-in).** `~/.waiver-install/<owner>.json` at `chmod 600` is a
  private key on disk — the same posture as any local App key or SSH key; opt-in and warned.
  Org installs never persist it.
- **`waiver setup` uses the adopter's own admin credential** (`gh`) for secrets/protection —
  deliberately separate from the App key, and never persisted by us.

Fail-closed remains the invariant everywhere: any ambiguity in setup stops and asks; any
ambiguity in the reviewer yields no review.

## 6. Decisions & rejected alternatives

Recorded per the "choose an answer, log the question" directive. Format: **question →
alternatives → chosen (why)**.

- **D1 — Autodiscovery source.** classic branch-protection endpoint · rulesets
  `/rules/branches/{base}` endpoint. → **Rules endpoint, classic as fallback.** Rulesets are
  the modern mechanism and the endpoint surfaces both; classic covers legacy repos.
- **D2 — Token for autodiscovery reads.** default `GITHUB_TOKEN` · App token. → **App token.**
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` has no `administration` scope; the App can hold `administration: read`. Ties
  autodiscovery to the App path, which `setup` always provisions. (Revisit if §7-V1 shows
  `contents: read` suffices.)
- **D3 — Manifest scopes.** minimal (contents+PR) · add `administration: read`. → **Add
  `administration: read`** to enable autodiscovery; read-only, low marginal risk. Drop if
  §7-V1 allows.
- **D4 — Keep any manual check list?** fully remove · keep an empty-by-default override. →
  **Keep an empty override** (`ci-checks`) purely as no-App / edge fallback; happy path writes
  none. Removes the *maintained* list (the user's ask) without stranding the default-token
  path. `lockfile-honesty-checks` input removed (folded into autodiscovery).
- **D5 — Identify the lockfile-honesty check.** fixed name constant · heuristic ("name
  contains lockfile") · optional `.waiver-stamp.json` field filled by setup. → **Optional
  `lockfileHonestyCheck` field**, read-from-base, default fail-safe (unmatched ⇒ keep the
  caveat). A constant is wrong (the check-run name is the adopter's job name — `assay` here,
  not `lockfile-assay`); the field is set by setup from the detected workflow. Flag gates only
  a warning string, so unmatched must fail *safe* (not silence).
- **D6 — Reusable-workflow packaging.** edit adopter's CI to add a job · standalone producer
  workflow + `workflow_call`. → **Standalone + workflow_call for both.** Lets setup avoid
  editing arbitrary CI YAML; the artifact-by-SHA lookup already supports it.
- **D7 — Reviewer trigger with a standalone producer.** trigger only on producer · trigger on
  all check-producing workflows, last-wake-wins. → **Multi-workflow, last-wake-wins.** Avoids
  a race where the reviewer wakes before the adopter's CI finishes and never re-checks.
- **D8 — Inject producer into existing CI?** yes (single wake) · no (standalone). → **No.**
  Can't safely edit arbitrary CI YAML on an operational repo; D7 removes the need. Offered as
  an optional manual optimization on the hand-off page.
- **D9 — Install target default.** personal · org. → **Org recommended when available** (org
  secrets → near-free multi-repo reuse); personal offered with the per-repo consequence noted.
- **D10 — Persist pem on disk?** always · never · opt-in personal-only. → **Opt-in,
  personal-only, `chmod 600`, default off.** Orgs never persist (org secrets suffice).
- **D11 — Secret scope.** repo · org · environment. → **Org for org targets, repo for
  personal; no environment by default** (simplest sufficient; environment supported as an
  option).
- **D12 — Editing existing config.** overwrite to a known-good state · additive merge with
  diff+confirm. → **Additive merge, diff, confirm, back up.** The repo is operational; never
  smash. Idempotent convergence over declarative replacement.
- **D13 — Where the spec lives / feature packaging.** one mega-PR · bookended stack. → **See
  §8** — prep refactor of the reviewer's check-resolution seam, then feature PRs, then
  cleanup.
- **D14 — `waiver setup` vs a separate installer binary.** new `setup` subcommand on the
  existing `waiver` CLI · standalone script. → **Subcommand.** Reuses the shipped bin,
  commander wiring, and exit-code contract; discoverable as `waiver setup`.

## 7. Open verification items (resolve during build, not blocking design)

- **V1 — `/rules/branches/{branch}` permission.** Does it return `required_status_checks`
  contexts to a `contents: read` token on a private repo, or require `administration: read`?
  Determines whether §2.6 default-token autodiscovery is possible and whether the App needs
  `administration: read` (§3.1/D3). Spec assumes admin-read (conservative).
- **V2 — Query-param prefill key names.** Exact param names for scopes on
  `settings/apps/new?…` (the §3.2 standalone fallback) — confirm `contents`, `pull_requests`,
  `administration` are the accepted keys.
- **V3 — localhost as manifest `redirect_url`.** Confirm GitHub accepts an
  `http://localhost:<port>` redirect in the manifest flow (Probot relies on it — high
  confidence, verify at build).
- **V4 — `create-github-app-token` + org secrets.** Confirm the reviewer minting flow reads
  org-scoped secrets identically to repo-scoped (name resolution, `secrets: inherit` through
  the reusable workflow).
- **V5 — Reusable-workflow `secrets: inherit` + App token.** Confirm the App token minted
  inside `review.yml` (from inherited secrets) carries App scopes independent of the caller's
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions block.

## 8. Build sequence (bookended)

Reasoning order: feature spike → prep → cleanup. Ship order: 0 → 1..N → N+1.

**Friction found (spike):** the reviewer computes its backstop set inline —
`main.ts:62` does `required = [...ciChecks, ...lockfileHonestyChecks]` straight from static
inputs, and `decide.ts` reads `lockfileHonestyConfigured` from an input length. Autodiscovery
needs to *vary how the required set and the honesty flag are resolved* without touching the
orchestration or the guards. That's a named seam.

- **PR 0 — Prep refactor** (`prep-check-resolution` off `main`): extract required-check
  resolution behind a `resolveRequiredChecks(deps)` seam in the reviewer — today it returns
  the static inputs; behavior-preserving, full suite green before/after. Removes friction:
  *"the backstop set and honesty flag are computed inline from inputs, so autodiscovery can't
  be slotted in without editing `run()`."* This is the only prep item — the rest is greenfield
  (new workflows, new manifest page, new CLI command have no existing code to fight).

- **PRs 1..N — Feature:**
  - **PR 1 — Autodiscovery** (`setup-automation-1`): implement `resolveRequiredChecks` to read
    the rules endpoint (App token), self-exclude `waiver-stamp`, match `lockfile-assay` for the
    honesty flag, keep the empty `ci-checks` override, remove `lockfile-honesty-checks`. Tests
    against faked Octokit (matrix legs, self-exclusion, empty→no-op, rules-then-classic
    fallback).
  - **PR 2 — Reusable workflows** (`setup-automation-2`): add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and
    `review.yml` (`workflow_call`) wrapping the existing actions; multi-workflow trigger model;
    dogfood this repo onto its own callers; update `examples/` + `docs/auto-approval-setup.md`
    to the collapsed callers.
  - **PR 3 — App manifest + loopback core** (`setup-automation-3`): the manifest builder
    (name/scopes/sanitize), the loopback server (form page, callback capture, conversion),
    browser open. Unit-tested with a fake GitHub endpoint; no secrets written yet.
  - **PR 4 — `waiver setup` orchestration** (`setup-automation-4`): preflight, target prompt,
    App reuse/disk/fresh resolution, secret provisioning, additive branch-protection merge,
    commitlint/husky handling, non-destructive workflow drop, install hand-off, the
    instructions page, `.waiver-stamp.json` seeding. Wired into `cli.ts`. Heaviest PR —
    split further if it crosses ~1000 lines (natural seam: provisioning vs. repo-config).

- **PR N+1 — Cleanup refactor** (`cleanup-setup-automation` off the last feature branch):
  remove the now-dead `lockfile-honesty-checks` plumbing and any manual-list references left
  in docs/examples/action inputs; delete the pre-autodiscovery `ci-checks`-required narration
  from `docs/auto-approval-setup.md` (keep only the override note). Pure removal.

Candidate prep for next time: if a future op needs more repo-config reads, the `gh`-shelling
in PR 4 will want a typed wrapper — note it, don't build it speculatively now.

## 9. What this deliberately does **not** automate (and why)

- **The two App clicks** — create (scope review) and install (repo-picker consent). Human by
  GitHub's design and by ours (§3.3).
- **`.waiver-stamp.json` policy** — a security judgment, closed-by-default, never widened by a
  tool (§4.11).
- **Editing the adopter's existing CI workflow** — arbitrary YAML on an operational repo;
  standalone producer removes the need (§4.8, D8).
- **Merge-strategy and `.github/**` protection** — one-click repo settings we surface as
  imperatives on the hand-off page rather than flip silently (§4.10).

Everything else on the `docs/auto-approval-setup.md` checklist is automated or made
paste-safe by A–C.
